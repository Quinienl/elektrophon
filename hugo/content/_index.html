                If you want to know more about the elektrophon visit the articles and modules pages. The modules contain all the information to build them yourself.
                When you do so, you do it at your own risk and and you are responsible yourself if you hurt yourself with electricity or burn your house down. 
                The hope you can get is that i have successfully building them and it did not harm my house at all.
