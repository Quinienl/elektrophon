excerpt: in this article different amplitude modulation techniques are explored and the relation to voltage controlled amplifierts is explained.
subtitle: Amplitude Modulation has its origin in electronic communication technology. It is used in radio transmission where an audio signal is modulated on a carrier signal. Amplitude Modulation is also used in synthesizers. When both signals in a VCA are in the audio range, the resulting audio signal has added timbre. Amplitude Modulation is also used in a Ring Modulator. Ring modulation adds frequencies to the audio signal which gives it a different characteristic. The resulting audio signal has some 'metallic' sound. The popular usage of Ring Modulation is the [Dalek](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Daleks) voice from the BBC series [Doctor Who](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who).
