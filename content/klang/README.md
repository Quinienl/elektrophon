When building modules for the synthesizer they also needs to be controller. For example the pitch of a VCO. In the modular world modules are controller with control volages (CV). There are various sources for a CV. For example a sequencer, ADSR but also an LFO or the DUSG. But when creating music the CV's might get complex for a sequencer and the series of voltages must be reproducable. For this purpose a [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) on a computer can be used. The standard interface controlling audio is [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI). This is a digital protocol, including note's notation, pitch, velocity. This digital information needs to be converted to CV's. The default connector for MIDI is a [180° five-pin DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector) connector. Unless you kept your [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) you most likely dont own a device with such an interface. for isolating the circuits from the computer and the synth a wireless protocol is preferend. It also seems the most practical way to connect the two. This module is build with a [blue pill]() [STM32]() module and connects with [bluetooth]() to the computer.

the CV Function Generator creates control voltages of different types. it can act as a standalone oscillator or create envelopes for controlling the pitch. but the channels are freely programmable and can also be used as a simple sequenver with variable cv output. this module should create sexteen individual controllable slopes or waveforms.instead of creating different dac and trigger channels, all channels slopes are created with a dac. every dac is freely assignable to a controll channel. the control channels are serial midi, envelope gerator, slope generator, cv sequenver. 

## *develop with the STM32*

the software is developed with the arduino IDE. before starting you must have installed the arduino software for you OS.

### *prepare the arduino IDE*

#### *install the STM32 board manager*

1) add the [STM32 for Arduino](http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json) url to the Additional Boards Manager list in the arduino IDE.
2)
